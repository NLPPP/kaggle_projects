This project aims to implement the above paper, in Tensorflow. Following which, improvements to the project in terms of adding more features, will be investigated. <br /> <br />
The Tensorflow implementation for the Hierarchical Attention Network was used in the Kaggle competition 'Quora Insincere Questions Classification':https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data <br /> <br />
The highest F1 score achieved in the competition currently by this model is 0.652 (ongoing effort!). 
<br /> <br /> 
For comparison, the highest score in the competition currently is 0.711.
